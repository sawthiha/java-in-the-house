The reason I applied this opportunity is to achieve a master degree research on semi-supervised learning model in ..... University. My experience of the Sakura Exchange program in .......... encourages me to continue my scholar life or work in Japan. Japan is a safe, peaceful and beautiful place to study and work.  Japan is of high educational standard and thus, higher supervision and knowledges are promising. Moreover,  I can continue my Japanese learning in the native environment while studing for my research. And, living in a Japanese culture and life-style will be the moments to be told for the rest of my life. I think there is no need to have a reason becaues Japan itself has all the reasons to devote my scholar life.
